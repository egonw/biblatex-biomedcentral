The biblatex-nature package provides an implementation of the 
bibliography style of the journal Nature for biblatex. This
implementation follows standard biblatex conventions, and can
be used simply by loading biblatex with the appropriate option

  \usepackage[style=nature]{biblatex}
   
A demonstration database is provided to show how to format
input for the style. 

The biblatex-nature style requires biblatex 1.2 or later, and works
with both BibTeX and Biber as the database back-end.
