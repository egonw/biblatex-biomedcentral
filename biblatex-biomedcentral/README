The biblatex-biomedcentral package provides an implementation of the 
bibliography style of the BioMed Central journals for biblatex,
and is based on the biblatex-nature work by Joseph Wright
<joseph.wright@morningstar2.co.uk>. This
implementation follows standard biblatex conventions, and can
be used simply by loading biblatex with the appropriate option

  \usepackage[style=biomedcentral]{biblatex}
   
A demonstration database is provided to show how to format
input for the style. 

The biblatex-biomedcentral style requires biblatex 1.2 or later, and works
with both BibTeX and Biber as the database back-end.
